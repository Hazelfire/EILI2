# Explain it like I'm 2 - Computer science
This is a repository of different papers written in LaTeX that outline concepts
in computer science to a larger depth than is usually taught.

The title of this repository is misleading, as the papers are more concerned
about depth of understanding rather than using simple language.

The principles used are:
- Keep it interesting
- Keep it complete
- Build the concepts from the ground up
